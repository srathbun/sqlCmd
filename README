Project: sqlCmd
Author: Spencer Rathbun
Date: 2011-12-22
Description:

This project is designed to provide a "value-added" sql mini language, as well as wrapping up the tedium of connecting to a remote MS SQL server via ODBC. It is designed to provide a transaction guarantee, such that if there is a connection failure, or simple exit, then the database will roll back the state. There are several rough edges to the program, some functions WILL break on some inputs.

Required libraries etc.
Python 2.7
pyodbc

Optional:
Replace cmd with cmd2, a better library
pyreadline
